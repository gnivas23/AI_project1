# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This is a simple Python implementation where you can play the classic game against the computer. The game runs in a terminal/command prompt and allows the user to input their choice while the computer randomly selects its choice.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, you will be prompted to choose between three options: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
2. You can play multiple rounds by entering one of these choices.
3. To exit the game at any time, type `quit` and the game will end.
4. After each round, the computer will randomly choose an option, and the winner will be determined based on the classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. The game will tell you if you won, lost, or tied after each round.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x or higher
